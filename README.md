## List of chrome extensions I developed
### Bookmark checker
An extension that checks whether a Google Search result is present in your bookmark. 
Disclaimer: the extension currently only works for `google.com` search result, not `google.com.<country_domain>` (e.g. `google.com.my`, `google.com.vn`, etc.)
## How to use
1. Download the extension's repository to your local disk
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer Mode** by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
4. Click the **Load unpacked button** and select the extension directory.

The extension is installed and ready to use
